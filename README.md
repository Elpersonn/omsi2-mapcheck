# OMSI 2 Map Integrity Checker
---
## What is this?
This is a program which, when given a valid OMSI 2 map directory will check all of it's .map files and check whether the splines, objects, attatchments and etc. in those files actually exist and will write out the names of the missing ones.

## How do I use this?
1. Download the binary (or compile if no binary is available)
2. Run the program
3. Enter a valid OMSI 2 map directory e.g. maps/London
4. Press start
5. Wait
6. If start becomes clickable again and nothing was printed out, the map *should* be fine
